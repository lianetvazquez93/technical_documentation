                    <p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.
                        Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that
                        emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs
                        that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.</p>
                    <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python
                        are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
                        <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
                        <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

            <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
                <header>Comments</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical
                        line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not
                        within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash
                        character. You can see several examples below.</p>
                    <code>    # this is the first comment
    spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
    # ... and now a third!
    text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">

                <article>
                    <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it
                        will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and /
                        work just like in most other languages and parentheses can be used for grouping.
                        For example:</p>
                    
                        <code>    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
    5.0
    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
    1.6
    >>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
    5
    >>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
    2
    >>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared
    25</code>
                    <p>The integer numbers have type int, the ones with a fractional part have type float.
                        The equal sign is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed
                        before the next interactive prompt:</p>
                    <code>    >>> width = 20
    >>> height = 5 * 9
    >>> width * height
    900</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
                <header>Strings</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several
                        ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same
                        result. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
                    <code>    >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
    'spam eggs'
    >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...
    "doesn't"
    >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead
    "doesn't"
    >>> '"Yes," they said.'
    '"Yes," they said.'
    >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
    '"Yes," they said.'
    >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'
    '"Isn\'t," they said.'</code>
                    <p>Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:</p>
                    <code>    >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
    >>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
    'unununium'</code>
                    <p>Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is
                        no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:</p>
                    <code>    >>> word = 'Python'
    >>> word[0]  # character in position 0
    'P'
    >>> word[-1]  # last character
    'n'</code>
                    <p>In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain
                        individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substring:</p>
                    <code>    >>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
    'Py'
    >>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
    'tho'</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Lists">

                <article>
                    <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values.
                        The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values
                        (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually
                        the items all have the same type.</p>
                    <code>    >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    >>> squares
    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code>
                    <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>
                    <code>    >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
    1
    >>> squares[-1]
    25
    >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
    [9, 16, 25]
    >>> squares[:]  # returns a copy of the list
    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code>
                    <p>Lists also support operations like concatenation:</p>
                    <code>    >>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]</code>
                    <p>Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, it is possible to change their
                        content:</p>
                    <code>    >>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here
    >>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
    64
    >>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
    >>> cubes
    [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]</code>
                    <p>You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method:</p>
                    <code>    >>> cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
    >>> cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
    >>> cubes
    [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]</code>

                    <p>Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together.
                        For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:</p>
                    <code>    >>> # Fibonacci series:
    ... # the sum of two elements defines the next
    ... a, b = 0, 1
    >>> while a < 10:
    ...     print(a)
    ...     a, b = b, a+b
    ...
    0
    1
    1
    2
    3
    5
    8</code>
                    <p>This example introduces several new features.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously
                            get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again.</li>
                        <li>The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true.</li> <li>The
                                body of the loop is indented: indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of grouping statements.
                                At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line.</li>
                        <li>The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. It differs
                            from just writing the expression you want to write in the way it handles multiple
                            arguments, floating point quantities, and strings.</li>
                    </ul>
